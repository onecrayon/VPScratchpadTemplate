# Advanced usage

Although your scratchpad is extremely capable without any modifications, you can customize it extensively to match your needs.  This page describes how to add custom textual tags, indices, composites, and more to make your scratchpad your own.

## Tags

As mentioned in About this scratchpad, the scratchpad has two types of tags: textual tags, and VoodooPad's native tags.  Textual tags are created automatically whenever you use the format `@tag` in a daily log or quick note entry.  A textual tag only applies to the line on which it occurs.  VoodooPad's native tags apply to entire pages, and you can use them for further categorization if you wish.  In addition, the scratchpad uses several special VoodooPad tags to construct its indices and similar auto-generated pages.  These special tags are:

* tag
* inbox
* log
* index
* composite
* excluded


**tag**  
A page tagged "tag" will show up in the Tags Index.  Additionally, whenever you open a page marked as a "tag", its contents will be automatically generated to show every line in the document with the textual tag that matches the page title.

Should you desire, you can create complex tags (that can contain spaces and don’t require an @ sign at their start) simply by creating a new link or page in your scratchpad, and assigning the page that’s created the “tag” tag.

Near the top of all "tag" pages, you will find the text "Edit above this line only".  You may place any custom content you want for a tag above that line; only the items below it are auto-generated by the script.  This can be a great way to store specific tasks, notes, URLs, etc. for a given project.


**inbox**  
A page tagged "inbox" may have quick notes appended to it.  Aside from the default inbox page provided with the scratchpad, you will need to create inboxes by hand.  Inbox pages are handy places to store snippets and action items, but do not have any special significance otherwise.  A page tagged with both "inbox" and "tag" will only append information above the "Edit above this line only" line.


**log**  
A page tagged "log" will show up in the Logs Index and will be formatted using the special log formatting when exported for the web.  You should never need to assign the "log" tag.  It is automatically added to daily logs as they are created, and there are no significant benefits to assigning the tag to a page that isn't a daily log unless you are migrating your logs from a previous system.  If for some reason you do wish to create a daily log page by hand, however, remember to assign it this tag in order for it to be added to the Logs Index and formatted correctly on web export.


**index**  
Assigning the "index" tag to a page tells the scratchpad that it should automatically generate a list of page titles when the page is opened.  In order for this to work, you must add the meta key "indexedTag" to the page and give it the value of the tag that is marking the pages you want indexed.  So for example, the "Index: Logs" page has the tag "index" and the meta info "indexedTag = log".  You can use the index tag and associated "indexedTag" meta key to automatically generate indices for any tagged group of pages.  You may optionally define a meta key "sort" with values "asc" or "desc" to sort the pages by title in ascending or descending order (always defaults to ascending).

Index pages also have some special optional meta keys: "start" and "end".  Define "start" to the name of a page you want to be the first page in the index and "end" with the name of the last page (inclusive).  For example, an index showing all logs in December 2008 might have the following meta tags: "start = 2008-12-01" and "end = 2008-12-31".  If the page names defined in "start" and "end" do not exist, the pages between those tags (alphabetically) will be included.

You do not need to use "end" if you define "start" and vice versa.  For example, if you only define "start", the index will include all pages from that page onward; only define "end" and the index will include everything from the first page to the "end" page.

Similarly to tag pages, you may only edit index pages above the "Edit above this line only" text.  Any other edits will be discarded when you reopen the page.


**composite**  
Much like the "index" tag, the "composite" tag tells the scratchpad to automatically generate the page's content.  Where indices show a list of links to the tagged pages, composites combine the entire text of each tagged page into one large whole.  After assigning the "composite" tag to a page, you must define the meta key "compositedTag".  You may optionally also define the meta key "separator" to tell the composited page what to separate pages with (defaults to "\n\n* * *\n\n"; "\n" is a linebreak), or the "sort" key (which acts identically as on "index" pages).

Composites also support "start" and "end" meta keys, just like index pages.

Also like tag and index pages, you may only edit composite pages above the "Edit above this line only" text.  Any other edits will be discarded when you reopen the page.


**excluded**  
Pages tagged with "excluded" will not show up on any auto-generated page.  This is particularly useful for excluding Python scripts from tag pages, for instance.


## Fonts and formatting

If you aren't a big fan of Courier, you can change the font used in your scratchpad by changing the font in the NewPageTemplate.  In order for the spacing to look good, you'll probably want to stick with monotype fonts, but if you're more comfortable with serif or sans-serif, feel free to do your own thing.  The entire scratchpad uses plain text (or Markdown for special pages like this one) in order to make it easier to work with and migrate elsewhere if you so desire, but if you're more of a rich text person feel free to tweak things.
