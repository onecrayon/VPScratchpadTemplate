# Welcome to your scratchpad

Your scratchpad is a specialized VoodooPad document for tossing all the random thoughts that pass through your head over the course of the day.  The important part of keeping a scratchpad is that it allows you to capture thoughts when they happen, and then access them later at your leisure.  You may use your scratchpad to keep yourself organized, share snippets and logs with your friends or coworkers, or for whatever else strikes your fancy.  Make it your own.

For a detailed description about the capabilities built into your scratchpad, read about this scratchpad. If you need to update an old VoodooPad 4 scratchpad for use with VoodooPad 5, see updating your scratchpad.  Otherwise, feel free to delete this text and use the links below to navigate.
